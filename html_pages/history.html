                        <p>Wood as a material for the
                            manufacture of products has a
                            number of advantages that none
                            
                            of the structural materials pos-
                            sesses. Wood has a low volume
                            
                            weight with relatively high
                            strength; pine, larch, fir wood
                            for each gram of its weight
                            withstands the same tensile
                            
                            load as steel, 3 times great-
                            er than cast aluminum and 7
                            
                            times greater than cast iron. The
                            thermal conductivity of wood is
                            2-4 times less than the thermal
                            conductivity of glass, 4-9 times <br/>
                            
                            less than the thermal conduc-
                            tivity of reinforced concrete and

                            hundreds of times less than the
                            thermal conductivity of steel.
                            Wood as a raw material is
                            used to produce many types of
                            products. These are furniture
                            (cabinet, lattice, upholstered),

                            joinery and construction prod-
                            ucts (windows, doors, parquet,

                            milled parts), musical instru-
                            ments (pianos, pianos, violins,

                            guitars, cellos), wooden vessels
                            (boats, yachts, canoes, rowing
                            vessels), sports equipment (skis, <br/>
                        
                            clubs, towns, bits), containers
                            (boxes, barrels, bottles), etc.
                                                    
                            Wood is an excellent materi-
                            al for the internal equipment
